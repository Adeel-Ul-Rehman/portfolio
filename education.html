                <p>The name of my school is C.D.G. Govt. Boys High School Chota Goun. It was established in 1976 and is
                    located in Lahore city, in Shahdrah Islam Pura. I spent 10 years of my life there and passed my
                    matriculation in 2020. It wasn't a big school, just a small one, but it had great personalities and
                    teachers. I made many friends who brought fun into my life and supported me in every aspect. We were
                    together through all the ups and downs of school life. I have very precious memories and unique
                    experiences from my school days that life has given me. In these pictures, you can see glimpses of
                    my school that gave me a great start.</p>

                <h2>College</h2>
                <p>My college is Islamia College Civil Lines Lahore. I got admission there in 2020 and passed my
                    intermediate exams in 2022. It's located in Lahore, and despite being one of the biggest educational
                    institutes in Pakistan, it has maintained a nurturing environment with supportive teachers and
                    friends. I've had countless memorable experiences and learned invaluable lessons during my time
                    there. Whether it was participating in extracurricular activities, studying in the library, or
                    simply hanging out with friends, every moment has contributed to shaping who I am today. Islamia
                    College has not only provided me with academic knowledge but also instilled in me a sense of
                    responsibility and independence that will stay with me throughout my life.</p>

                <h2>University</h2>
                <p>I'm studying Computer Science at University of Engineering and Technology (UET), Kala Shah Kaku
                    campus, one of Pakistan's biggest government universities. I began my studies here in 2023 after
                    taking a year off due to a leg injury from an accident. Initially, I had planned to join COMSAT
                    University Lahore for software engineering in January 2023, but had to change plans due to my
                    injury. Despite not starting at UET's main campus, I'm happy with my choice. Here, I've learned more
                    than I ever imagined, thanks to supportive friends who also act as mentors, introducing me to new
                    technologies and techniques. It's been an enriching journey, and I'm eager to continue growing and
                    become a skilled computer scientist by the time I graduate.</p>
