                <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
        </nav>

        <div class="text-container">
            <h2 class="s1">Get know <span>Adeel</span> Ul-Rehman</h2>
            <p>My name is Adeel ul Rehman, and I was born on 23rd February 2003 in Arifwala, Pakpatan. We moved to
                National Fan Colony, Shahdara, Lahore about 15 years ago. Our family is quite large with five
                siblings—three sisters and two brothers.

                I started my schooling at C.D.G Boys High School in Chota Goun, Islampura, Shahdara, Lahore. Those were
                the days filled with joy and learning. I made many friends who have stuck with me through thick and
                thin. In 2020, I passed my matric exams with flying colors, securing 897 out of 1100 marks.

                Next, I joined Islamia College Civil Lines, Lahore, in 2020. My college years were full of experiences
                and joyful moments and finally in 2022 i passed inter with 989 marks. Despite facing challenges in
                getting admission to universities like GCU and PU, and struggling with the ECAT exams, I never gave up.
                Finally, in January 2023, I got admission to COMSAT University Lahore. But the very next day, fate took
                a turn—I was in a serious accident with my cousins, and I ended up with a broken leg. It took six months
                of rest to recover, and I had to let go of my university admission.

                But with faith and determination, I gave the ECAT exams again when UET Lahore reopened its admissions.
                Despite being unprepared and on a wheelchair due to my leg, I scored 196 marks. That was enough to get
                admission to UET's Kala Shah Kaku campus in Computer Science. My degree duration is from 2023 to 2027.
                These years at UET are being a time of growth and practical learning, where I've been able to develop my
                skills and pursue my passion for programming.

                Looking ahead, I have big dreams. I want to pursue a master's in Italy, specializing in AI, and return
                to Pakistan to start my own company. I envision integrating AI into everyday business to boost
                productivity. Alongside this, I plan to start a bus travel agency and explore other business
                opportunities with my friends.

                Beyond academics, I'm deeply passionate about AI and its impact on society. I love developing websites
                and hope to leave a mark through innovative digital solutions. My journey has been shaped by significant
                experiences, especially my accident, which taught me to rely on faith and resilience. Believing in
                Allah's guidance and the power of prayer has become central to my approach to life's challenges.

                My work experience includes call centers, data operations, and factory work, where I've gained diverse
                skills. Despite facing financial pressures and the stress of university admissions, I hold firm to my
                values—dedication to family, respect for others, and a drive to make a positive impact.

                In conclusion, my journey is about determination, resilience, and a strong belief in faith and hard
                work. I'm committed to creating a better future for myself, my family, and society.</p>
